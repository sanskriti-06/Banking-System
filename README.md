#### **Overview**
This project implements a simple banking system using **Python** and **pandas** for data management. Users can:
- Register and set a secure password
- Log in and manage their balance
- Perform banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries
- Store user credentials in an **Excel file (`customer.xlsx`)**

#### **Prerequisites**
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** and **openpyxl** for Excel data processing  
  ```sh
  pip install pandas openpyxl
  ```
- The `customer.xlsx` file will be auto-created if it doesn't exist.

#### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/banking-system.git
   cd banking-system
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python banking_system.py
   ```

#### **Files Included**
- `banking_system.py` → Main Python script with banking operations  
- `customer.xlsx` → Stores user data and balances  

#### **Future Enhancements**
- Implement **GUI** for better user experience  
- Enhance security features for password encryption  
- Use a **database** instead of Excel for better scalability  

#### **License**
This project is open-source and free to use. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
